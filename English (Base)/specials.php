So only if you stay away for a longer period of time, it's better to accept a longer trip.\n\n But there's more; if you have an older truck or trailer (as in age of the truck/trailer), you will even get less money for a longer trip, because the maintenance cost will be really high.\n\n So if you want to stay away for longer periods of time and because of that, accept longer trips, you should buy a newer truck/trailer.
